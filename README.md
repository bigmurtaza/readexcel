# readexcel
I am trying to read excel file and read data.

First I want to reach all files at a directory so that I have all the data. I need to make sure I read ALL The excels
Then I want to find a team or teams depending on what my input is. So that I can find if their stadium is done or not.
If I did their stadium I want to change the is_stadium_exist value to TRUE from FALSE
