# readexcel
I am trying to read excel file and read data.

First I want to reach all files at a directory so that I have all the data. I need to make sure I read ALL The excels
Then I want to find a team or teams depending on what my input is. So that I can find if their stadium is done or not.
If I did their stadium I want to change the is_stadium_exist value to TRUE from FALSE

Update, 12/17/2021: I am able to identify automatically if a stadium exists for related team and put data down to excel.

Next: Type a search-find system, eg. when I type Manisa, I should be able to see all teams containing word "Manisa".
Make an executable with a simple UI for the process.
